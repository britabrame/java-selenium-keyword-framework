--- Prompt ---
Provide a code sample of a Selenium/keyword-driven framework created in 4-6 hours.

--- Introduction ---
This is a sample of a "keyword-driven" Selenium/Java framework which executes test cases where the steps, objects, and
  locators are externally defined in an excel sheet. The advantage of such a framework is that once all keywords are defined
  and methods implemented for each, there should be very little or no additional coding needed to extend the framework,
  as users can simply add test cases into an excel sheet.

--- Features currently included in the framework ---
 - A file located in ...\java-selenium-keyword-framework\src\main\java\excelData\testCases.xlsx contains the test
 cases that will be executed.
 - Test case excel template:
    - Title: title of the test case, appears on the same row as the first test step
    - Step ID: Test step id
    - Keyword: Action to be performed; currently supported keywords are "openBrowser," "goTo," "input," "click,"
    "closeBrowser"
    - Object: The value of the locator id, class, or xpath
    - Object Type: Object's locator type; valid values are "Id," "class," or "xpath"
    - Data: Data that is necessary to perform the action (username, password, search criteria, etc)
    - Description: Description of the test step

--- Current limitations ---
Following features are not present in this implementation, but should be later implemented:
- Support for Asserts: Asserts can be implemented as any other keywords, such as "assertElementVisible,"
or "assertValue" using TestNG or JUnit test frameworks.
- Reporting: There is no integration with any reporting tools, but it could be added using a tool such as ExtentReports.
- Test case validation: Currently the test case excel sheet allows the user to input any values into the Keywords column
without validation, but ideally users would be provided a sheet where the Keyword column has dropdown values
 corresponding to the currently supported keywords.

--- How to execute test script ---
 - Execute the tests from the ExecutionTest class.
 - It is expected due to the time limit on this assignment that the test script will fail to execute all steps in it's
 current state, but currently the user should be able to see the navigation to https://www.saucedemo.com/, input of
 username and password, and login.
